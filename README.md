# Slide Menu - An Intuitaive Sliding Menu for App With User Profiles.
Slide Menu is based on a popular format for including a gesture based menu screen alongside a home screen.

This project uses delegation to manage user interactions using a central 'container' controller. This allows for a smooth user experience where many screens can be accessed from the home screen by sliding out the menu.
